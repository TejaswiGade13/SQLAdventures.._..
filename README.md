# 🗺️ SQL Adventures

> **Learn SQL the student way — with tips, tricks, and teamwork!**

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the amount of things you need to learn in SQL?  
Ever wondered how others make sense of complex queries or remember every clause?

**SQL Adventures** is a peer-driven, beginner-friendly space for students (like you and me!) to explore SQL in a way that's approachable, practical, and actually fun.

## 🚀 What is this repo?

A structured learning guide divided into:

- 🐣 **Beginner** – Basics, syntax, and your first SQL statements  
- 🚶 **Intermediate** – Grouping, joins, nested queries, and logic  
- 🧗 **Advanced** – Complex joins, optimization, and real-world patterns  

Each folder includes:
- 📚 Curated notes
- 💡 Cheat sheets
- 🧠 Practice problems
- 🔗 A **sandbox link** to try queries directly (via [sql-playground.app](https://www.sql-playground.app))

## 💡 Why this project?

Because sometimes:
- Reading long documentation isn’t enough  
- Stack Overflow can be intimidating  
- And official tutorials skip the “real beginner” stuff

So here’s a project made **by a student, for students** — a peer-led guide for tackling SQL confidently.
